        <h3>What are the blockchain certificates?</h3>
        <p>
            In essence, they are digital representations of your physcial certificates. Technically, we create a
            JSON that contains the certificate information, then sign and hash it, and place the hash on the Bitcoin
            blockchain. If you'd like to learn more about their architecture, please check out the <a
